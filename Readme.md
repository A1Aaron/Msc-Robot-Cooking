The following directory is a ROS package with the relevant scripts to run the DMP learning framework. *ROS and MOVEIt required*.

1 - CharucoDetection.py
2 - CharucoCameraCalibration.py
3 - capture_traj.py
4 - getfinalpose.py
5 - SinglePoseEstimation.py

The output is the DMP files to be run on the MyCobot platform whcih would then perform te learned trajectories
